## 🚀 Performance Comparison & Design Decisions

### ✅ **Reasoning Behind the Design**
After analyzing different storage strategies, we explored multiple options and implemented an optimized **AsOf-based time-series storage** solution.

---

## 🆚 **Timestamp-First vs. ID-First Storage Approaches**

Below is a concise advantages/disadvantages list comparing two time-based storage models.

### **1️⃣ Timestamp-First Approach**  
(Your `TimeSeriesStore<T>` Design)  
Data is stored as:

```csharp
Dictionary<DateTime, Dictionary<string, T>>  
// or  
ConcurrentDictionary<DateTime, ConcurrentDictionary<string, T>>
// or
Dictionary<string, SortedList<DateTime, T>>
```

### ✅ Advantages<br>
📅 Global Timeline – Easy to inspect the entire system at each timestamp.<br>
📌 Full Snapshot Access – Direct dictionary access to fetch all data at a given time T.<br>
🔄 Efficient Iteration – Timestamps are stored in a structured manner, making iteration straightforward.<br>

<br>

### ❌ Disadvantages<br>
🔍 Expensive Single-ID Lookup – Finding an individual ID at a given time may require iterating timestamps.<br>
📈 Scaling Issues – Sorting and searching timestamps can be slow for large datasets.<br>
⚡ Concurrency Complexity – Managing locks at the timestamp level can introduce performance overhead.<br>

### 🧐 Choosing the Right Approach
<br>
Query Type	Best Approach
<br>

| Query Type | Best Approach |
|------------|---------------|
| What was the state of all IDs at T? | 🏆 Timestamp-First |
| Show me the last known value for ID X at T? | 🏆 ID-First |
| High-frequency time-based queries | 🏆 Timestamp-First |
| Drill-down per ID over time | 🏆 ID-First |

## 🏆 Verdict
If you prioritize global snapshots → Use Timestamp-First<br>
If you prioritize per-ID lookups → Use ID-First<br>
If you need both → Combine the two approaches!<br>

### 🔀 Can We Do Both?
Yes! By combining both structures, we get the best of both worlds.

#### 1️⃣ Maintaining Duplicate Structures
Each new data entry is stored twice:

```csharp
// Timestamp-First
Dictionary<DateTime, Dictionary<string, T>>  
// ID-First
Dictionary<string, SortedList<DateTime, T>>
```

### ✅ Pros
- ⚡ Fast "as of" lookups for both timestamps and single IDs.
- 🔄 Flexible – Handles different types of queries efficiently.
### ❌ Cons
- 🏗 Double Storage – More memory consumption.
- 🔄 Complex Concurrency – Both structures must be kept in sync.


### 2️⃣ Single Master Store + Secondary Indexes
Instead of storing everything twice, maintain a single master event log:

```csharp
List<(DateTime Timestamp, string ID, T Value)>  // Master log
SortedDictionary<DateTime, List<(ID, T)>>  // Index for timestamp-first queries
Dictionary<string, SortedList<DateTime, T>>  // Index for ID-first queries

```
### ✅ Pros
- ✅ One Source of Truth – Reduces data duplication.
- 🔧 Index Flexibility – Allows custom indexing strategies.
 
###❌ Cons
- 📈 Index Overhead – Requires additional storage for indexes.
- 🔄 Concurrency Complexity – Must update master + indexes atomically.



### 1) Dictionary<DateTime, Dictionary<string, T>>
#### Structure

- Outer key: DateTime – Points in time.
- Inner key: string – IDs or entities for which you store data at that time.

#### How It Works

- For each timestamp, you keep a dictionary (of ID → value). This allows you to quickly see all IDs that changed (or have data) at a particular timestamp.
- Lookup: To find all data at timestamp t, you can directly do _data[t] (if it exists).
- “AsOf” queries (e.g., find the most recent data at or before t) may require iterating timestamps in descending order (or using a sorted dictionary for faster searching).

#### Advantages

1. Global Snapshot: If you often do “What is the state of every ID at time X?” this is a direct lookup.
2. Simpler if Timestamps Are Main Driver: If your system is primarily organized around when events occur, this approach aligns well.

#### Disadvantages

1. Single ID Lookups Are Costly: If you always want “the state of ID X at time T,” you have to find which timestamps contain X.
2. Scaling: With many timestamps, iterating keys can be expensive unless you maintain a data structure like SortedDictionary<DateTime, ...> for quick searching.
3. No Built-In Concurrency: A standard Dictionary<,> is not thread-safe. If you have multiple readers/writers, you need locks.

### 2) ConcurrentDictionary<DateTime, ConcurrentDictionary<string, T>>

#### Structure

Similar to #1, but uses concurrent variants.

#### How It Works

- This design is the thread-safe version of timestamp-first storage.
- The outer dictionary is a ConcurrentDictionary<DateTime, ...> so multiple threads can safely add or retrieve time buckets.
- The inner dictionary is also a ConcurrentDictionary<string, T> so multiple threads can safely add or retrieve values for IDs within the same timestamp.

#### Advantages

- Built-in Thread Safety: Reduces the need for external locks (although you may still need coordination if you want atomic operations spanning multiple timestamps/IDs).
- Retains Global Snapshot Logic: Same as #1—one dictionary per time point, but now concurrency is handled more gracefully.

#### Disadvantages

1. Potential Overuse of Concurrency: If you are also layering locks on top, you could introduce overhead or complexity.
2. Same Single-ID Lookup Issue: You still have the same structural overhead if you want to quickly find all data for a single ID across time.
3. Complex Concurrency Scenarios: Even with concurrent structures, you may need higher-level synchronization for consistency across multiple timestamps.

### 3) Dictionary<string, SortedList<DateTime, T>>

#### Structure

- Outer key: string – IDs or entities.
- Inner key: DateTime in a SortedList – The timeline for that ID.

#### How It Works

- You store each ID as a dictionary entry. The value is a SortedList<DateTime, T> (or some sorted structure), enabling you to keep data points in chronological order for that particular ID.
- Lookup: To find the data for ID X at time t, you search the SortedList<DateTime, T> to get the largest key <= t (a binary search approach).

#### Advantages

1. Efficient Single-ID Queries: Quickly find data for ID = X at time t without scanning irrelevant IDs or timestamps.
2. Localized Updates: Inserting new data for one ID only modifies that ID’s timeline.
3. Easy “AsOf” Implementation: A sorted list can do a binary search to find the correct index for a particular DateTime.

#### Disadvantages

1. Global Snapshot Is Harder: To gather “all IDs at time t,” you must iterate over every ID in the outer dictionary and do a search in each SortedList. This can be slower when you have many IDs.
2. Maintenance of SortedList: Inserting timestamps must maintain sorted order, so large inserts in the middle might be costlier than in a hash-based structure.
3. Thread Safety: A standard Dictionary<,> and SortedList<,> are not thread-safe, requiring additional locking or concurrency strategies in multi-threaded environments.

### Which Structure to Choose?
Ultimately, your choice depends on:

#### 1. Query Patterns

- Timestamp-First structures are best if you frequently need a global snapshot at a point in time.
- ID-First (with SortedList<DateTime, T>) excels if you often query “as of” a specific time for one or few IDs.

#### Concurrency Needs

- If you have multiple threads reading/writing, you either need a concurrency-enabled collection (ConcurrentDictionary) or to manage your own locking.

#### Data Volume & Access Patterns

- Large volumes of data with frequent single-ID queries? → ID-based approach.
- Large volumes with frequent “snapshot of everything at time X”? → Timestamp-based approach.

#### Complex Queries

- If you need both types of queries to be equally fast, consider dual-index or secondary indexing (storing data in both forms or maintaining a master log and building indexes).

In summary, each structure has unique advantages for different usage patterns. If you find you need both global snapshots and rapid single-ID lookups, you can maintain multiple data structures in parallel—though that increases memory usage and implementation complexity.
